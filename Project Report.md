Certainly! To develop a 2D Occupancy Grid Map of a room using overhead cameras, we need to follow several steps. Below, I will provide a complete Python solution along with instructions for running the code in Google Colab.

### Overview of the Solution

1. **Capture Images**: Acquire images from an overhead camera.
2. **Image Processing**: Preprocess the images to detect and classify occupied vs. unoccupied areas.
3. **Generate the Occupancy Grid Map**: Convert the processed images into a 2D grid map.
4. **Display the Map**: Show the 2D Occupancy Grid Map for visualization.

### Prerequisites

To run this code in Google Colab, you'll need to:
- Upload images to Colab or use an image URL.
- Install required Python packages if not already available.

### Python Code

Here's a step-by-step implementation of the solution.

```python
# Step 1: Install necessary libraries
!pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib numpy

import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Function to preprocess images
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Check if the image loaded properly
    if image is None:
        raise ValueError("Image not found or path is incorrect.")
    
    # Apply Gaussian Blur
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Threshold the image to get binary occupancy map (0: unoccupied, 255: occupied)
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(blurred, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
    
    return thresh

# Step 3: Function to generate the Occupancy Grid Map
def generate_occupancy_grid(thresh_image):
    # Convert the binary image to a grid map (0: unoccupied, 1: occupied)
    grid_map = (thresh_image / 255).astype(np.uint8)
    
    return grid_map

# Step 4: Function to display the Occupancy Grid Map
def display_occupancy_grid(grid_map):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.imshow(grid_map, cmap='gray', vmin=0, vmax=1)
    plt.title("2D Occupancy Grid Map")
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
# Upload your image to Colab (you can use the following code to upload files)
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Assuming 'room_image.jpg' is the file name
image_path = 'room_image.jpg'

# Preprocess the image
thresh_image = preprocess_image(image_path)

# Generate the occupancy grid map
grid_map = generate_occupancy_grid(thresh_image)

# Display the occupancy grid map
display_occupancy_grid(grid_map)
```

### Running the Code in Google Colab

Here’s a step-by-step guide to run the provided code in Google Colab:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Notebook**: Go to `File` -> `New Notebook`.

3. **Install Packages**: Copy and paste the following code into a cell to install the necessary packages:

    ```python
    !pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib numpy
    ```

4. **Upload Image**: Add another cell and paste the following code to upload your image:

    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    uploaded = files.upload()
    ```

   - After running the cell, a file upload dialog will appear. Upload your room image (e.g., `room_image.jpg`).

5. **Preprocess and Display**: Add another cell and paste the rest of the provided Python code. Make sure to set the `image_path` variable to the name of the uploaded image (e.g., `'room_image.jpg'`).

6. **Run the Cells**: Run all cells in sequence.

### Example Image Upload and Testing

If you don't have your own image, you can use the following example code to download a sample image from the web:

```python
!wget -O room_image.jpg https://example.com/path/to/sample_room_image.jpg
```

Replace `https://example.com/path/to/sample_room_image.jpg` with the URL of any sample room image you have.

### Additional Considerations

- **Camera Calibration**: For real applications, consider calibrating the camera to correct for lens distortion and perspective issues.
- **Occupancy Detection**: The threshold value in `cv2.threshold` can be adjusted based on your image’s lighting and contrast conditions.
- **Advanced Processing**: Depending on your needs, you might use more advanced techniques like edge detection or machine learning models for occupancy detection.

### Conclusion

This code provides a basic implementation of a 2D Occupancy Grid Map generation system. For more advanced applications, you might need additional features like real-time image capture, dynamic updates, or more sophisticated image processing techniques. 

Feel free to expand on this example based on your specific requirements and scenarios!
